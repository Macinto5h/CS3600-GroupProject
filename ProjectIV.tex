  \par For each of the tables, answer the following questions, and use what you
  have learned in the Normalization chapter to justify your answers:
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item What are the IC's for this table? Turn them over to FDs.
  	\item Where does the table sit in the normalization hierarchy by applying the
  	checking as we went through in class and described in the textbook/notes?
  	\item If this table is not in BCNF, follow the procedure which we just went
  	through in the class, to decompose it into a collection of tables that are in
  	BCNF.
  	\item When you turn the table into BCNF, does it preserve all the FD's? If
  	not, which ones are added and/or dropped?
  \end{itemize}
  \par\textbf{Customer table:}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*]
  	\item It's primary key is a unique Id that is found in the Person table. \newline
    $FD: Id \rightarrow ReceivesMail$
  	\item BCNF - The customer table is BCNF. There is the Primary key, Id, there are no other non-trivial candidate keys used, therefore there are no non-prime attributes in the table that would be able to be determined through the proper subsets from the non-existant candidate keys. There are also no transitive functional dependencies. There is only one Superkey and it directly determines the other attributes in the table.
  	\item We do not have to do any decomposition since the table is already BCNF.
  	\item Since this table was already in the BCNF format no FDs were added or dropped.
  \end{enumerate}
  \par\textbf{Department table:}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*]
  	\item It's primary key is the unique attribute Id. \newline
    $FD: Id \rightarrow DeptName$
  	\item BCNF - The department table is similar to the last one. There is the Primary key, Id, there are no other non-trivial candidate keys used, therefore there are no non-prime attributes in the table that would be able to be determined through the proper subsets from the non-existant candidate keys. There are also no transitive functional dependencies. There is only one Superkey and it directly determines the other attributes in the table.
  	\item We do not have to do any decomposition since the table is already BCNF.
  	\item Since this table was already in the BCNF format no FDs were added or dropped.
  \end{enumerate}
  \par\textbf{Employee table:}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*]
  	\item It's primary key is a unique Id that is found in the Person table. \newline
    $FD: Id \rightarrow PayRate,\ Position$
  	\item BCNF - The employee table is similar to the last one. There is the Primary key, Id, there are no other non-trivial candidate keys used, therefore there are no non-prime attributes in the table that would be able to be determined through the proper subsets from the non-existant candidate keys. There are also no transitive functional dependencies. There is only one Superkey and it directly determines the other attributes in the table.
  	\item We do not have to do any decomposition since the table is already BCNF.
  	\item Since this table was already in the BCNF format no FDs were added or dropped.
  \end{enumerate}
  \par\textbf{Person table:}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*]
  	\item It's primary key is the unique attribute Id. \newline
    $FD: Id \rightarrow FirstName,\ LastName,\ PhoneNum,\ Email,\ Address$\newline
    $FD: FirstName, LastName \rightarrow Id,\ PhoneNum,\ Email,\ Address$
  	\item BCNF - The Person table is similar to the last one. There is the Primary key, Id, there are no other non-trivial candidate keys used, therefore there are no non-prime attributes in the table that would be able to be determined through the proper subsets from the non-existant candidate keys. There are also no transitive functional dependencies. There is only one Superkey and it directly determines the other attributes in the table.
  	\item We do not have to do any decomposition since the table is already BCNF.
  	\item Since this table was already in the BCNF format no FDs were added or dropped.
  \end{enumerate}
  \par\textbf{Product table:}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*]
  	\item Product's stock attribute cannot be less than zero. The price of a product must be greater than or equal to zero (also must have only two decimal digits, achieved with round function) It's primary key is the unique attribute Id. \newline
    $FD = Id \rightarrow Price,\ Name,\ Artist,\ Stock,\ ReleaseDate$\newline
    $FD = Artist,\ Name \rightarrow Id,\ Price,\ Stock,\ ReleaseDate$
  	\item BCNF - The Product table is similar to the department table. There is the Primary key, Id, there are no other non-trivial candidate keys used, therefore there are no non-prime attributes in the table that would be able to be determined through the proper subsets from the non-existant candidate keys. There are also no transitive functional dependencies. There is only one Superkey and it directly determines the other attributes in the table.
  	\item We do not have to do any decomposition since the table is already BCNF.
  	\item Since this table was already in the BCNF format no FDs were added or dropped.
  \end{enumerate}
  \par\textbf{Sales table:}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*]
  	\item Every sale must contain a unique id, a product id, and a customer id. Quantity of a sale item must not be greater than the stock value found in the given product. No sale of item can occur before that product's release date. SalesId and
  	ProductId are the two attributes that make up the primary key. The SalesId alone can
  	uniquely identify the CurrentDate and CustomerId. When the SalesId and ProductId are 
  	given the following attributes can be found: Quantity, IsReturned, and ReturnDate.
  	 When converted to FD's we get the following relationships:
    $SalesId\rightarrow CurrentDate,\ CustomerId$, $SalesId,\ ProductId\rightarrow
    Quantity$,\newline and 
    $SalesId,\ ProductId\rightarrow IsReturned,\ ReturnDate$
  	\item 1NF - The sales table is 1NF because you can easily get the CurrentDate and CustomerId information related to the sale if you were to just use SalesId. Which, violates the 2NF requirement, where you should not be able to determine information from a subset of the candidate key. The candidate key is $\{SalesId,ProductId\}$, and SalesId is a subset from that candidate key.
  	\item When following the procedure and algorithm for making a table follow the BCNF
  	standard, we get two new tables. The first table derived from Sales is almost 
  	identical to the original, except that it omits the attributes, CurrentDate and 
  	CustomerId. This removes the relationships that are not accepted in BCNF for the
  	table\newline (FD: $SalesId\rightarrow CurrentDate,\ CustomerId$). Those relationships are
  	then placed into another table with the attributes SalesId, CustomerId, and 
  	CurrentDate. Both of these new tables satisfy the BCNF conditions, so the Sales
  	table was decomposed successfully. Also, for the purpose of better organization, we 
  	made a third table where it holds the attributes SalesId, ProductId and ReturnDate under 
  	the table IsReturn. This is mostly so that returned items are organized into a separate space.
  	\item Not all of the Functional Dependencies are preserved after the table is 
  	converted to abide the BCNF. Most notably, the FD:
  	$SalesId,\ ProductId\rightarrow CurrentDate, CustomerId$ was removed because it would
  	fail the conditions to qualify for 2NF. 
  \end{enumerate}
  \par\textbf{WorksIn table:}
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*]
  	\item It's primary key is a unique EmployeeId that is found in the Employee table. \newline
    $FD = EmployeeId \rightarrow WorksSince,\ DeptId$
  	\item BCNF - The WorksIn table is similar to the department table. There is the Primary key, Id, there are no other non-trivial candidate keys used, therefore there are no non-prime attributes in the table that would be able to be determined through the proper subsets from the non-existant candidate keys. There are also no transitive functional dependencies. There is only one Superkey and it directly determines the other attributes in the table.
  	\item We do not have to do any decomposition since the table is already BCNF.
  	\item Since this table was already in the BCNF format no FDs were added or dropped.
